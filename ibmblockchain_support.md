## Case severity and initial response times

When opening a support case, assign the severity level as follows:

| Severity | Business impact | Initial response time | Details |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 4 | Minimal | Within 8 hours | An inquiry or non-technical request. |
| 3 | Some | Within 4 hours | The product, service, or functions are usable, and the issue doesn't represent a significant impact on operations. |
| 2 | Significant | Within 2 hours | A product, service, business feature, or function of the product or service is severely restricted in its use, or you are in jeopardy of missing business deadlines. |
| 1 | Critical | Within 1 hour | **System or Service Down**  \n Business-critical functions are inoperable or a critical interface has failed. This usually applies to a production environment and indicates an inability to access products or services that results in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. |
