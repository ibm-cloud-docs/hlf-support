# Getting started
{: #hlf-support-tutorials-getting-started}

Use the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric getting started tutorials to get hands-on experience building and using an IBM Blockchain network. 
{: shortdesc}

**Target audience:** This topic is designed for architects, system administrators, and developers who are responsible 
for planning, configuring, and developing applications for {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} 2.5.2 networks.

Use the getting started tutorials to investigate how to [build a network](ibm-hlfsupport-console-build-network.md) 
and [join a network](ibm-hlfsupport-console-join-network.md) on IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric.

You can also watch the [video series](reference/videos.md) to learn how to deploy a peer, deploy an ordering service, 
and create and join a channel.
